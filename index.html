    <h1>Your Friendly Coffee Handbook</h1>
    <p>We’ve all been there, standing in line at a favorite coffeeshop, sweating because we’re not entirely sure of the difference between a cold brew vs. a classic iced coffee. Oh gosh, I know I have. Good news: we’re covering everything from the difference of Arabica and Robusta coffee beans to all the ways to brew your favorite cup of joe. Hold on tight. We’re diving deep into your morning go-to drink.</p>
    <h2>Different Types of Coffee Beans</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt><strong>Arabica</strong></dt>
        <dd>Arabica beans have a <em>sweeter, more complex flavor</em> that you can drink straight. Funny thing is, even though it’s the most popular, it doesn’t have as much caffeine as Robusta.</dd>
        
        <dt><strong>Robusta</strong></dt>
        <dd>While Arabica is the most popular, Robusta is <em>cheaper and stronger</em>. Because of its bitter flavor, you’ll typically see Robusta used for espresso drinks and in instant coffee mixes.</dd>
